PROJECT OVERVIEW : 

It is a project which hopes to build a image detection AI model based on a neural network to help in detection of early changes in medical imaging studies 
such as MRI and CT scans in order to help clinicians in reaching a diagnosis by identifying subtle early changes and often unnoticed marks 
which may not be conventionally noticed.

Mentor : Vidip Gadde

Im a medical student currently pursuing MBBS from AIIMS Mangalagiri,
who is interested in research and development of AI models to improve health care and treatment outcomes for the patients

NOTE TO CONTRIBUTORS :

the project is expected to be a bit complex because of the need to develop an image detection model based on neural network.

knowledge on various neural networks and their advantages to our current goal would be helpful.

knowledge on languages such as python would be helpful.
